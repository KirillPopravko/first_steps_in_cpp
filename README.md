# Introduction to C++

This repository is for teaching / learning C++ alongside Bjarne Stroustrup's book: [Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html). It is forked from [this repository](), but with added bugfixes, Visual Studio solution for windows users, and extra assignments.

# Usage

Clone the repository. 

If you are on windows, use Visual Studio to open the solution. From there, you have a hello_world working just as in the book, and you can just replace it with each of the code samples from the book.

On linux, you should use the Makefile to compile, and a code editor of choice to edit FirstStepsInCPP/hello_world.cpp and other .cpp files.
